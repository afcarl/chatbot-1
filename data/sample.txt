i know, i know, i'm white. but i don't even hear it. obv it exists. but largely a media/machine concept at this point. to distract
the magic of trump, and i'll admit he's talented, is that he gets ppl to co-sign on heinous stuff under the guise of "america 1st"
i wish their secondary could have been tested by a competent qb

decent warmup, afterwards look at this yugh story!
if you've served as an election judge in the u.s., i need your help for a project. email me here.
you're originally from syracuse? i lived there years ago. moving out was one of the happiest days of my life! :)
out here reppin
damn straight
blood clot in brain: fine now debilitating cough: allergies carried after a collapse: just heat but you can totally trust she's fit to lead!
and that's what they admit! god knows what they are hiding
they need to work something out, this whole situation is retarded.
their biggest fear is user manipulation of certain trophies with the use of mods. dead serious.
the cowboys got the redskins after a monday night loss on a short week. now they get the bears after a monday night loss on a short week
and the bears have gotten pretty beaten up tonight.
i'm going to see if my place offers it but i think they only do regular physical therapy
i used to go to this place in grand concourse and 159 i think, and i did acupuncture there. so good. the asian lady hooked me up
tim tebow finishes the day as the best selling jersey in baseball, according to sales rankings on fanatics &amp; mlb official online shop.
how much will the make on them ? need to start saving to resign
if you have dry skin it's good!
what about the coverage ?

but that shouldn't impact the share within a given year, right?
you didn't like it? i forgot you wasn't there 🤔

jay cutler is just the worst
great, you cursed him
i can see why other people would like the sleekness of it. but i find apple's inconvenience to be...well, inconvenient.

who the chicago tribune reporters picked in this game (h/t , )
the tribune still has that many reporters? that's shocking.
